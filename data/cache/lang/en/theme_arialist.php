		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Arialist is a very clean and simple two-column, fluid-width theme for Moodle 2.0.</p>

		<h2>Tweaks</h2>
		<p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it, then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you\'ll still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p>

	<h2>Credits</h2>
	<p>This theme was coded and is maintained by Patrick Malley of NewSchool Learning. He can be contacted by email at contact@newschoollearning.com. </p>

		<h2>License</h2>
		<p>This, and all other themes included in the Moodle core, are licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
