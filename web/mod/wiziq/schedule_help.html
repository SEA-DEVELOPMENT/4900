These classes are private to you and can be launched by you and your course students only. You may use &quot;Class URL&quot; to promote your live class in blogs and websites. Your scheduled class gets automatically published in your event calendar. You can launch your class from there. No sign-up is required to give or attend a class. 

To schedule WiZiQ live classes for your time zone, make sure that you select your time zone in terms of 'UTC' or 'GMT' e.g. 'GMT+4:30' or 'UTC+7:30' in your Moodle profile. 

Multi-room subscription users can schedule simultaneous classes with duration up to 300 minutes, for 50 participants and use other features. Against 3 recordings available to a single room user they can record more classes and download recordings too.
